For Prediction of Student's Performance, we will use following algorithms:

Linear Regression

Lasso Regression

Decision Tree Regressor

Random Forest Regressor

By using the above algorithms, will firstly explore the data that I have and check for any null or missing values. If found then I'll clean tha data and then visualize it for better understanding. Then I'll proceed by data training i.e. spliting data into training and testing data. Then train our model by providing training data and once the model will be trained, will perform prediction. After prediction, will evaluate the performance of these algorithmns by error check and accuracy check.
Steps followed are as:

Step 1: Data Exploration

Step 2: Data Visualization

Step 3: Data Tra ning

Step 4: Model Creation

Step 5: Performance Evaluation

Conclusion






Accuracy of Decision Tree Regressor is higher than Linear Regression, Lasso Regression and Random Forest Regressor.
